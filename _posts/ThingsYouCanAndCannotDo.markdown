You can pick your nose and you can pick your friends but you can't pick your friend's nose. 

You can't pick your friends if the context is that they're in a police lineup. You can pick your friend's nose if the context is that you are weird.

If your friend needs facial reconstructive surgery and asks you for help picking a nose, you are permitted to pick their nose **BUT!** this does not make it your nose, and you are not free to pick it from then on. 

You're allowed to pick what your friend knows, for example on a gameshow where you pick trivia questions for a teammate. But you can't do the same if the rules of that gameshow forbid it, like in *Pick What Your Friends Don't Know!* or *Pick What Your Friends Don't Know: The Boardgame*.

You can't pick up your friends. Once you've picked them up, they'll be more than friends. And then they'll be too heavy.

You can know your friend's pick, especially if you borrowed it to do some prospecting in your backyard, but then you realized you already had one and you need to keep track of which one is which. You can't pick your friend's nose, ie hit it with a pick, even if they have not returned something of yours. 

You can pickle your friend's nose if and only if they have consented and either the nose had already come detached or the friend is dead. Is someone still a friend once they've died and you've pickled their nose? That's left as an exercise to the reader.

Brief sidenote: if you've already picked your friend's nose (via pick, see above) and it came detached as a result, you should probably be cautious about asking to pickle it. 

You can't pick your friend's nos. If your friend says no, you've gotta accept it regardless. Remember we talked about consent before? That's still a biggie. You can, however, no your friend's pick for like a restaurant or whatever. And if you know your friends pick you can no it before they pick it.

You can drink your friend's Nos if they offer it to you, or if you really need the caffeine and you know they won't mind. You can't drink the can, regardless of who it belongs to.

You can Friend your friends, but you can't Friend their pics. If you find your friend's pics, you can Like ones that you pick if you like them. You can also Like pics that you don't like, 
but tread carefully because you're being very misleading with behavior like that, sir.

You can open your friend's can when it's full and but you can't can it until it's empty. 

You can't cam your friend's can (tuccus). You certainly can't show the cam to your gran.
