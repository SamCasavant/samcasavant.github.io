The average distance between two points on a line from 0 to 100 is 50.

The average distance between two points on a grid from (0, 0) to (100, 100)

In one dimensional space, set on a discrete grid, the shortest path between any two points (x1) and (x2) is a line, the only path between them. The number of points x distance away from any point is two. 

In two dimensional space, set on a discrete grid, the shortest path between any two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is a line, one of . There are 

In infinite dimensional space, the shortest path between any two points is
