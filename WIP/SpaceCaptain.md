*Somewhere between the stars and the celestial masses, there exists an ancient realm known only as 'Space'. Left unguarded for millenia, it fell into disrepair. Now, an elite police force has been dispatched to reclaim Space. These guardians are Space's only hope.*

###Episode 3: Space Captain

There are no rules in space. Really, there aren't rules anywhere. Rules are information layered over a material reality by information experiencing a material reality. Or, in the case of space, an immaterial reality. But, in space, no one is trying to enforce any rules either. 

As a result, spacecops have a very difficult job. The most difficult part of a spacecop's job is the boredom. Spacecops are often found slept to death, sometimes with the head yawned clean off.

Harls Slarly was the captain. *I'm the captain,* he thought. He sat down. Jenkins scurried across the room.

"I can't have you doing that, Jenkins," said Captain Harls, "I'm the captain, you know."

Jenkins did not know. Jenkins was a complete oaf.

"Get it together, Jenkins."

The captain looked forward at space. *That is where we should be going,* he thought. He went to access the navigation panel but hit his hand hard against the table on the way up. *This is why captains have hook hands,* he thought, instead of swearing. 

"Christ! What's the heading, computer."

"*We are going forward, towards space.*"

"Very good, forward on."

You can't get to space. Try though you might, space is always gone by the time you get there. This is a pressing concern for spacecops, who must always be moving forward towards space. In order to effectively police space, it is necessary for spacecops to be spread evenly across the universe. The ideal solution is to have spacecops travel to initial positions first and then hold them there while keeping them alive until the rest of the force can get into position. This is a substantial process, but JobAI is not concerned with time. 

The good captain furrowed his brow. His ship followed his every order but still he worried of mutiny. This crew was a crew of cowards, unfit for her majesty's fleet, but necessary to rescue the kidnapped princess and the world's largest diamond which she wore on her neck. And the rumors that the princess had invented a new kind of sandwich could not be idly ignored either. 

Jenkins chewed on a houseplant, and the location of the houseplant inside of a spaceship failed to inform its title as an object. But would a spaceplant still smell as sweet?
