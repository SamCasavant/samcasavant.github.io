Art Falcon Says His Goodbyes

It was an old ship- ten-thousand years- and for ten thousand years it had remained silent. But in the ten-thousand and first, it called out into the darkness. "I am The Aerdz," it said, "and all is lost." The Communion of Interplanetary States recepted the signal, and it raised red flags. The Aerdz had been a criminal ship, and it had flown out into deep space with a great deal of stolen Visucian wealth. The Visucians remained, and they belonged to The Communion. When the Visucians were given the location of treasure that was theirs by law, their course of action was clear. 

Art Falcon was the greatest adventurer who had ever lived. No one could list all of his achievements. He had risked his life thousands of times and done more for the universe than anyone, living or dead. He was an obvious choice to retrieve stolen treasure.

"Honestly, I don't know guys. It sounds boring. I usually like things with a little more danger. Some thrill."

"We thought you'd appreciate the mystery of it," offered the Visucian Council, "Why did it say 'all is lost', what's the treasure, that sort of thing."

"That certainly is an appeal. But you're asking me to travel for 3 months, and there's not even a chance that I die?"

"The Aerdz is a Class VII Visucian Cruiser, an ancient thing, it'll have defenses you've never encountered before."

"I doubt that very much. But you're winning me over. I keep the standard 5%?"

"You do. And we'll supply the dartship."

"Fair enough."

Falcon traveled alone for most of his adventures. It was a necessary consequence of interspace jumps- they required exponentially greater fuel for additional organic matter. This adventure was no different. The shortest route to the Aerdz involved two interspace jumps. 

"It wasn't theft

"People who live like I do tend to die young. People who don't don't have reason to go on living. 

The new becomes the old, becomes the ancient.
